# Smart Box IoT

## NOTE: This is not the original repository! All credits go to: https://github.com/andrewkristofer/SmartBox-IoT
## 📖 Overview
This project is developed as part of the Despro 2 (Design Project 2) course.
The focus is on designing, simulating, and testing an embedded hardware system using Proteus as the primary development environment.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Sensor integration (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.)

✅ Real-time data monitoring in simulation

✅ Automatic actuator trigger when threshold is reached

✅ Fully simulated hardware in Proteus (no physical components required)

✅ Expandable for real-world prototyping

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Proteus 8 Professional – Circuit design and simulation
- C/C++ (Arduino/ESP32/AVR) – Microcontroller programming
- GitHub – Version control and project collaboration
